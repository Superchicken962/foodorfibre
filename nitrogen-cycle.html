<h3>
  The nitrogen cycle is the cycle of which nitrogen is converted into different and multiple chemicals<br>
  as it circulates in the atmosphere. The process doesn’t end and loops back for whichever happens.<br> 
  Now, for the explanation of the process for the nitrogen cycle and the processes. Let us start with<br>
  the animal, living our life until we die. Luckily, we don’t go to waste and we are decomposed and then<br>
  turned into ammonium (NH4). How exciting, we then proceed to nitrification and we become nitrites (NO2),<br>
  then nitrates (NO3). There are two paths we go from here; one is that we go into plants which can die<br>
  and decompose or get eaten by an animal and have the process start again. The second path is<br>
  more interesting, we become atmospheric nitrogen (N2). From the atmosphere we go back into<br>
  the soil and can either live with the legume roots or we can go back into ammonification and start all again.
