<h3>
  The nitrogen cycle is the cycle of which nitrogen is converted into different and<br>
  multiple chemicals as it circulates in the atmosphere. The process doesn’t end and<br>
  loops back for whichever happens. Now, for the explanation of the process for the<br> 
  nitrogen cycle and the processes. Let us start with the animal, living our life<br> 
  until we die. Luckily, we don’t go to waste and we are decomposed and then turned<br> 
  into ammonium (NH4). How exciting, we then proceed to nitrification and we become<br> 
  nitrites (NO2), then nitrates (NO3). There are two paths we go from here;<br> 
  one is that we go into plants which can die and decompose or get eaten by an animal<br> 
  and have the process start again. The second path is more interesting, we become<br> 
  atmospheric nitrogen (N2). From the atmosphere we go back into the soil and can<br> 
  either live with the legume roots or we can go back into ammonification and start all again.<br>
