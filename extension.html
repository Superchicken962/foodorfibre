<h2>How can the plant-based diet become more approachable to the larger population??</h2>

<h3>
  A plant-based diet for the human population could be possible. There are some people who<br>
  already are on full plant-based diets, which is fine but them forcing this upon other people may influence the public in the other direction and to them not taking on a semi plant diet. We do not have to rule out meat altogether, meat consumption just needs to be controlled and limited. A start to this could be advertising how the cycles work and educating the population. Easing into this will take a fair while but in the end, emissions will be reduced.
