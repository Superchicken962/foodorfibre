<h3>
  The carbon cycle is a biogeochemical cycle where carbon is traded among the earth’s<br>
  different spheres; the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, biosphere, pedosphere, and the<br>
  geosphere. the atmosphere is the layer that contains gasses, or air.<br> 
  These gasses are kept in place by earth’s gravity. The hydrosphere is the total water<br>  
  amount that is on the earth, including underground water and not just lakes and rivers.<br>  
  The biosphere pretty much represents and is the sum of all the ecosystems on the earth.<br>  
  It can also be known as the ecosphere. Pedosphere is simple, the most outer layer of the<br>  
  earth, composed of soils. Finally, we get to geosphere. The geosphere defines as the rocks,<br>  
  minerals, landforms of the surface and in the crust of the earth. Time to look at the carbon<br>  
  cycle. Now, starting in the animal. Again. The animal will respire, releasing carbon.<br>  
  The animal will also release carbon after dying and decomposing. When respiring,<br>  
  the carbon is released into the atmosphere, where it becomes carbon dioxide (CO2).<br>  
  The carbon released from the decomposed animal also gets released into the atmosphere<br>
  and becomes carbon dioxide (CO2). The decomposed animal will also compound into<br> 
  inorganic carbon which becomes organic carbon, which feeds into the plants. The cycle<br> 
  repeats now, the animal will either eat parts of the plant, or will breathe in oxygen<br> 
  produced by the plant.<br>
